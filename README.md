# PLL
A resistor carrier board for aiding in RGH 3 installs.  

My personal system gave me some troubel. So I came up with an idea to make changing resistors a lot easier.   
There's spots for no resistor, 1k ohm, 2k ohm, 3k ohm, and 10k ohm. You just bridge the approptiate pad for the value you want.  
I used 402 sized componants to save space, I wouldnt get them made any thicker than .8mm which JLCPCB and OSHPark both offer decent prices for.  
Because it's using 402 componants you can use JLC's economy assembly to save money if you dont want to make them by hand.

# Waiting on the prtotypes to make sure everything lines up right. So have them made at your own risk currently.
